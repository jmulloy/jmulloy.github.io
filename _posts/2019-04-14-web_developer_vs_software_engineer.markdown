There is a lot of misconceptions in reference to the topic of web developers and software engineers. For those that aren't familiar with technology and the different types of career paths, all 3 of the titles listed above are thought of to be the same thing. Spoiler alert - that is not the case. There is a fine line between the different types of work that can be done within the programming side of the IT world. Let's take a look at Web Development first. 

Web Developers are thought of as the ones who solely work on web applications. There are a few exceptions every now and then but for the most part Developers read, write, and manipulate code to produce or fix a web application. Web Developers can build websites, web applications and even smartphone applications depending on the depth of their knowledge in reference to programming. Some may think that web developers are engineers and in a way they can be. For the sake of this blog post we will try to draw a fine line between the different types of roles and what would be expected of an individual who got hired for one of these types of positions. Let's take a look at engineering next and see what the differences can be. Lots of different backgrounds can align with development including: graphic design, wordpress, Web Design, etc. Web development uses computer code to create user-facing software, in the form of websites.

When I hear software engineer, I think of these types of people as other types of engineers. They usually have a deep knowledge and understanding of programming in 1 or more of the common programming languages. Software engineers usually look at the bigger picture and overall structure of how to the app or program will function. Engineers are usually the ones who will build a foundation for an app and help others figure out how data will communicate from one side of the app to the other. Software engineering is focused on the programs (or software) used in computer systems. Software developers are responsible for conceptualizing, creating, programming, documenting, testing, improving and maintaining software, software components, and frameworks.

Overall non technical people view both job titles as the same but for those of us involved in the world of IT we know that is not the case. To resolidify the differences, I like to think of software engineers as the ones who help establish the “foundation” of the application, whether the application is web based or not. Where as the developers on the other hand are the ones that decide how the house will look and what materials will make up the actual establishment.
