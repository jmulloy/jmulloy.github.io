The CLI Data Gem project was one of my first goals I set when I started the Flatiron Web Development Course. This project was my first true test of my knowledge that I have learned so far since starting. I have been eager to get started and obviously to finish the project and see exactly what I understand/ took away from the course so far. Though there were quite a few bumps in the road throughout the duration of the project, I was able to confidently debug my code and get everything working properly. 

At first I was a little intimidated with the idea of opening a blank IDE/environment and building something from scratch with little to no guidance from the start. However I quickly realized how much I had actually learned by being able to use the videos included in my cohort and the Learn.co curriculum to get things started. The CLI project is something that requires a lot of patience and sometimes frustration. However once I was able to get in the groove of things and "map" out what I was trying to do I realized I had the skills and patience that is needed to complete this project in a timely manner.

One thing I learned quickly as a general rule in life is that if "you do what you love you will never work a day in your life". I am a firm believer of this phrase. This is the reason I decided to do my CLI project on something I was passionate about which is Video Games. I figured the project wouldnt be so bad if I was working on a project that I could relate to the information on a personal level. 

One of my biggest frustrations since starting the course has been working on a lab or in this case the project in particular when things dont work the way you originally planned. It was brought to my attention that this is just the way things are in programming and that it is up to me as a soon to be developer to work through these frustrations and make sure everything is consistently working properly. In the CLI project I ran into lots of different errors which ranged from simple syntax errors all the way to making nothing run within my program. Thankfully I was able to debug most of it myself and sometimes with the assistance of the great instructors/ fellow students at Flatiron. 

This project was an eye opener for me personally. Having a blueprint laid out was one of gthe easiest parts. Figuring out how to navigate the blueprint is where the challenges presented themselves. I had a large number of issues with my code throughout the entire process of working on the test. One particular instance had to do with my #list_games method. This method in particular was one of the methods I used to give my CLI a large amount of functionality. I knew what this method needed to do in the back of my head but for whatever reason I could not get it to work. Each time I would try to debug the method I would somehow create further issues within my code. This was one of the most frustrating parts oif the entire process. I felt like I was personally moving 1 step forward while at the same time takming 2 steops backwards. However after a few breaks and some out of the box thinking I was able to navigate through my own code and fix what I needed to fix. 

Even after hours of frustration and potential "Rage-quits" (gamers will know what this is), I was able to finally get my code working the way I originally planned. This project was a true test of my skills and now that I am almost across the finish line my excitement has grown to continue on my path to become the best developer I possibly can. This project not only tested my abilities and skills as a programmer but also my patience to stay calm and continuously work towards getting my program to function flawlessly. I am looking forward to more challenges and projects in the future throughout the rest of my time here at Flatiron!
