I have always been a fan of computers since I was a young lad. I have often found com,puters fascinating and of course the ability to play video games, but that is beside the point. I have always been curious about computers. This curiosity has led me down the path of taking things apart (which my folks were not happy about especially if I couldn't put it back together). I quickly realized how deep the rabbit hole really was. 

When I was in College I saved up enough money to purchase a PC primarily for gaming. I quickly realized that there were so many moving parts that I could cvhange, remove, add, etc. that would allow me to improve my stykle of gameplay as well as how my PC ran overall. This led to hours upon hours of youtube suring or "tubing". As a gamer you are always wanting the best of the best simply to improve on what I already had. 

After realizing how much went into the hardware aspect I quickly started asking questions about why a specific game would function the way it did within an operating system. This is where the gears in my head quickly transitioned from a hardware thought process to a software process. Which I will not lie, seemed very complicated and way beyond what I thought I knew.

My most recent employment opportunity in my career was for a software company. I was working on the sales team offering SaaS or Software as a Service to different clients. In order to sell the product and beat the largew number of competitors we had, I had to learn the in's and out's i.e. functionality of our web platform and the mobile interface we offered. I quickly realized that I was asking more about why than how simply out of curiosity. This wasn;t a good approach for a sales rep because the clients did not care why they just wanted to know "how" it worked and why it would benefit them. 

While working for my employer, a colleague of mine said I had a good background in hardware that the company used and I should consider looking into learning how to build software like the one my company built from the groun up. He got me in contact with one of his mate's (he was from England) who took the time to meet with me and skim the surface of what he does as a senior software engineer here in Denver, CO. Immediately I was intrigued by what he showed me and pointed me in the right direction for different resources to look into to make sure it was the best fit for me. After conducting further research I realized writing code provided me with a sense of gratification and accomplishment that I rarely felt in a sales role. 

After looking into it further and making the decision to look into schools I found Flatiron through searcghing the web. I immediately enrolled in thebootcamp course to make saure this is something that I wanted to do and commit to full time. After starting the bootcamp I quickly realized that this is something I could be passionate about. Not just as a "job" but as a career move as a whole. 

I have been very happy to get involed with coding and working towards becoming the best software engineer I can be. 

Thanks,
